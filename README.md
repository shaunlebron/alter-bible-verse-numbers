# Bible Alter Map

Standard verse numbers for [Robert Alter’s Hebrew Bible][1]

* chapter boundaries fall along different verses
* some verses are merged
* some superscriptions are promoted to verses

## Files

* `books.json`: standard books of the Bible
* `map.json`: map from standard Bible verses to Alter Bible verses
* `code.js`: code that creates `map.json`
