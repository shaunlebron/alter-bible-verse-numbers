# Bible Alter Map

Standard verse numbers for [Robert Alterâ€™s Hebrew Bible][1]

Alter wrote a great Bible translation, but it uses ~2820 non-canonical verse
numbers, making it difficult to compare across translations. (Chapter
boundaries fall along different verses, some verses are merged, and some
superscriptions are promoted to verses.)
